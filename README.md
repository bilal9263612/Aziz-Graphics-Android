# Aziz Graphics: Minimalist HTML File Manager for Android

**Aziz Graphics** is a lightweight, minimalist Android application designed to embed and manage local HTML files within its own interface. It provides a clean, dark-themed environment for users to organize and quickly access their HTML-based tools or content, ensuring they remain accessible even if the original file is moved or deleted from the device's storage.

The application is built with a focus on performance, minimal resource usage, and a unique, modern UI aesthetic featuring glassy elements and a pure black background.

## ✨ Key Features

*   **HTML Embedding and Persistence**: Users can select local HTML files, which are then embedded and copied into the app's private storage. This ensures the content remains available even if the original file is deleted from the device.
*   **Unique Page Creation**: Each embedded HTML file creates a unique, dedicated page within the app, accessible via a custom folder icon.
*   **Minimalist Dark Theme**: The entire application uses a pure black and dark gray color scheme, prioritizing a clean and unobtrusive user experience.
*   **Custom Glassy Folder Icons**: Each file is represented by a unique folder icon featuring a **glassy, blurred layer** over a pure black background with subtle, moving **green nano-particles**, as per the design specification. Each icon is assigned a unique color for easy identification.
*   **File Management**:
    *   **Rename**: Users can assign a custom display name to each embedded file.
    *   **Pin/Favorite**: Files can be pinned for quick access, appearing at the top of the file list.
    *   **Delete**: A long-press action brings up a context menu to delete the file from the app's storage.
*   **Performance**: Developed using native Android features (Kotlin/Java) and minimal external libraries to ensure fast load times and smooth performance on lower-end devices.

## 🎨 Design & Branding

The app's branding is based on the provided "Aziz Graphics" logo.

*   **App Icon**: A minimalist icon featuring the stylized blue arc and the letter 'A' from the logo on a pure black background, with a subtle glow effect.
*   **Splash Screen**: Displays the "Aziz Graphics" logo on a pure black background with the subtle, moving green nano-particles effect before navigating to the main screen.
*   **UI/UX**: Follows a strict minimalist design language with small, streamlined buttons and a focus on the dark, glassy aesthetic.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

*   **Language**: Kotlin and Java
*   **Platform**: Android (Optimized for Android 8.0+ / API 26+)
*   **Dependencies**: AndroidX, Material Components, Gson (for file metadata persistence).

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Project Structure

The project follows a standard Android project structure. Key files include:

*   `app/src/main/java/com/azizgraphics/`: Contains all Kotlin source code (Activities, Data Classes, and `FileManager`).
*   `app/src/main/res/`: Contains all UI layouts, drawable icons, and color/style definitions for the dark theme.
*   `aziz_graphics.jks`: The generated keystore file for signing the application.
*   `signing.properties`: Contains the keystore credentials for Gradle.

### Build and Run

1.  **Clone the repository** and open the project in Android Studio.
2.  **Sync Gradle** to download all necessary dependencies.
3.  **Build and Run** the project on an emulator or physical device.

### Keystore Information

For building a release APK, the following keystore details were used to generate the `aziz_graphics.jks` file:

| Parameter | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Keystore File** | `aziz_graphics.jks` |
| **Store Password** | `aziz_store_pass` |
| **Key Alias** | `aziz_graphics_key` |
| **Key Password** | `aziz_key_pass` |

These credentials are also stored in the `signing.properties` file for easy integration with the Gradle build system. **Note**: For a production application, it is highly recommended to change these default passwords and secure your keystore file.

## 🖼️ Design Assets

The custom design assets are included in the project:

*   `app/src/main/res/drawable/app_icon.png`: The main app icon.
*   `app/src/main/res/drawable/splash_background.png`: The background for the splash screen.
*   `app/src/main/res/drawable/folder_icon_template.png`: The base image for the custom glassy folder icons. The app dynamically applies color tints and handles the particle animation effect in the UI code.
